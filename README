                        MUMPS Version 1.64

  This version of mumps runs on FreeBSD, NetBSD, many linux versions,
  OSX 10.4 through 10.9 in 64 and 32 bit mode and Solaris.  This version
  is also available for windows (tested on XP and Windows 7) and on
  the Raspberry Pi (ARM) processor (for embeded MUMPS).

  First select a directory (such as your home directory) that does NOT
  contain a directory or file named mumps.
  
  Then, download mumps-1.64-src.tar.gz from 	
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/mumps/files/ and un-tar.
  or enter:
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@mumps.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/mumps checkout -P mumps

  This will create a mumps directory in the current directory.
  Change to this directory and type make.  The resulting mumps executable
  will be optimised for this system.

  NOTE: On cygwin, first follow the instructions below and for NetBSD it may
	be necessary to copy BSDmakefile to Makefile.

	On cygwin and solaris, $H is GMT as these implementations don't have
	a local time offset.

	On OSX 10.9 (Mavericks), you have to get cvs and gcc from somewhere.
	The gcc included invokes clang which just doesn't work.  Once you
	install gcc from gcc-4.9-bin.tar.gz - delete /usr/bin/gcc.

  To use, first create a database, eg:
	./mumps -v TEST -b 16 -s 1000 testdb

  then, start the environment, eg:
	./mumps -j2 testdb

  then, load the unitities, eg:
	./mumps -x 'O 1:("utils":"R") U 1 R X X X' testdb

  The environment is then started using:
	./mumps testdb
  or
	./mumps -x "D ^%M" testdb

  Remember to shut it down when you are done to free the shared memory.
  Do either M> K ^$J or MCL> D ^SSD

  		NOTES on cygwin

  For windows, install the Cygwin environment at http://cygwin.com/install.html

  Run cygwin terminal (on win7 or win8 run it as administrator).

  Setup the Cygserver using /usr/bin/cygserver-config.

    edit /usr/include/cygwin/shm.h
       add near end 
       #define SHM_R       (IPC_R)
       #define SHM_W       (IPC_W)

    edit /usr/include/cygwin/ipc.h
       move third last #endif 3 lines up

		VISTA FILEMAN CODE

  Download mumps-vista.tar.gz from:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mumps/files/

  Create group vista and ensure you are a member of this.

  Prompt> sudo tar -C / -xzvf mumps-vista.tar.gz
  Password: ********
  x usr/vista/
  x usr/vista/runvista
  x usr/vista/startvista
  x usr/vista/vistadb
  Prompt> sudo chgrp -R vista /usr/vista
  Prompt> sudo chmod -R g+w /usr/vista

  Fetch the appropriate mumps executable from the above sourceforge location.

  // To startup MUMPS with VISTA

  Prompt> sudo /usr/vista/startvista

  Creating share for 16 jobs with 2mb routine space,
  10mb (320) global buffers, 128kb label/map space
  and 16kb for locktab.

  // and to run that environment

  Prompt> /usr/vista/runvista

  // This runs in the MUMPS standard MCL environment
  // to shutdown using MCL CD MGR then D ^SSD
